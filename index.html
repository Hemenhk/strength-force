        <h1>Different Types Of Exercises</h1>
        <p>The Difference Between Compound and Isolated Exercises.</p>
        <div class="row-ex">
            <div class="ex-columns">
                <h2>Compound</h2>
                <p>Compound exercises are exercises that activate multiple muscle groups at the same time. For example,
                    a deadlift is an exercise that target not only the back, but also the quads, hamstrings, rear delts,
                    biceps and traps, as well as your core. These are exercises that generally require more attention to
                    technique, and as such, we have linked videos that go into further detail as to how to perform them
                    properly, as it is easier to hurt yourself doing them with poor technique.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="ex-columns">
                <h2>Isolated</h2>
                <p>Isolated exercises are exercises that target only one muscle group at one time. For example a bicep
                    curl only target the bicep, unless done wit incredibly poor technique. These exercises are great at
                    sculpting the particular muscle groups, and are a great way to ensure lagging muscle groups are
                    targeted to achieve an aesthetic physique. As an example, calves are a muscle group that men
                    typically neglect at the gym, which causes an imbalanced physique. This can be rectified by
                    isolating the calves with particular exercises.</p>
